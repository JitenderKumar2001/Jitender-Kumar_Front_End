What problems / warnings are there with code?

=> The 'isSelected' prop in the 'SingleListItem' component is not being set correctly. It should be isSelected={selectedIndex === index} instead of isSelected={selectedIndex}. This is because 'isSelected' should be a boolean value that indicates whether the current item is selected, but in this code, it is being set to the selectedIndex value, which is either null or an index.

=> 'setSelectedIndex' is not a function. It should be just const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(); in the WrappedListComponent.

=> The PropTypes for the items prop in the 'WrappedListComponent' is incorrect. It should be items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({text: PropTypes.string.isRequired})) instead of items: PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({text: PropTypes.string.isRequired})).

=> The 'onClickHandler' function in the 'SingleListItem' component is not properly wrapped in a function. Instead of onClick={onClickHandler(index)}, it should be onClick={() => onClickHandler(index)}. This is because onClickHandler should be a function that takes an argument, but in the given code, it is being called immediately with the index value.
